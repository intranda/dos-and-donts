## Do: ask your scanning service provider to make interim deliveries.
If you choose to outsource the job of scanning to an external provider, you should ideally request a series of interim deliveries rather than one large final delivery. This will help you to ensure that the outsourced work is consistently of the required quality and to keep check on your overall project schedule. Ideally the contractor should upload the data directly to your system rather than supplying a hard disk.
