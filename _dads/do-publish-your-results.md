## Do: publish your results.
In the ideal scenario, digitization results should be made publicly available. The OAI-PHM and SRU interfaces provide established standards that allow other users, harvesters and portals to make use of your data. External partners can also work with the data that you supply or enrich it using crowdsourcing platforms.
