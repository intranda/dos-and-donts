## Do: think about effective (long-term) archiving.
Reliable methods of long-term archiving can be expensive. In the ideal scenario, it may be possible to cooperate with other institutions and share the cost. If this is not an option, you will need to find effective alternatives. Archiving systems should be easy to maintain, and it must be possible to retrieve the archived data at any time. When choosing the most appropriate system, you should consider whether to store the data in two geographically separate locations.
