## Don't: make up new metadata standards.
Only existing and open standard formats should be used for descriptive metadata. Avoid creating your own new document types and metadata definitions. The MARC and MODS standards of the Library of Congress are generally adequate for most purposes.
Under no circumstances should the end product of your digitization workflow be in a proprietary format. Wherever possible, you should work with established formats such as METS/MODS, LIDO and EAD for descriptive metadata and ALTO or TEI for full text.
