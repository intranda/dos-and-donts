## Do: conduct pre-checks on data received from partners.
If you plan to work with a partner, you should ideally request and conduct pre-checks on a relatively large body of data before commencing the project. Actual data provide the only reliable indication of whether all the project partners have the same understanding of the delivery format. The later you receive and pre-check the data, the greater the risk that a large volume of data could be produced in the wrong format and therefore be unusable.
