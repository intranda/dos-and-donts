## Do: make judicious use of the available options for extracting and recording metadata.
Your approach to extracting and recording metadata should be judicious and pragmatic. Researchers using your digital collection will appreciate being able to locate and open a particular chapter on the basis of descriptive metadata. By contrast, few users will be interested in the distinction between a title, formal title, uniform title, heading, other titles, title proper and an equivalence. Equally, most users will be happy with the author's given name and family name, so there may well be no need to include additional name information such as titles, prefixes, numbers, nicknames, or generic names.
