## Do: scan the color chart on each page as well
Ideally, each scan should include a color chart. This does not usually pose a problem for subsequent processing or when displaying the image as it can be detected and hidden through automated cropping. 

Incidentally, color charts don't last forever and should occasionally be replaced.
