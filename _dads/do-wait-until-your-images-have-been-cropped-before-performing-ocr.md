## Do: wait until your images have been cropped before performing OCR.
As a general rule, OCR should not be performed until your images have been cropped, black borders removed, the book-fold area trimmed, and the images deskewed or scaled. Otherwise there is a risk that the full text and the corresponding word coordinates (e.g. in the output ALTO files) will no longer match the modified image coordinates.
