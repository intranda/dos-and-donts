## Don't: allow uneven lighting conditions in the scanning room to spoil your images
The brightness of the images produced by most scanners and cameras will vary depending on the ambient lighting conditions (summer/winter and morning/afternoon). Although they have their own integrated lighting systems, they are nevertheless influenced by other light sources in the room due to the way they are designed. Ideally, this should be thoroughly checked at least once for each device. Even hardware that is advertised as operating independently of ambient light can deliver surprising results under close examination of two photographs taken under different lighting conditions.
All images of the same object should be taken under constant lighting conditions.
