## Don't: stick notes or labels onto old source material.
Barcodes, dockets, notes and other information should only be stuck onto old source material in exceptional cases. The chemicals used in the glue can seriously damage valuable objects. Ideally, any additional information should be provided on inserts or cover sheets made of acid-free paper.
