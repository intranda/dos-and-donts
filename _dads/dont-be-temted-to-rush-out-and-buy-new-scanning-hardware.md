## Don't: be tempted to rush out and buy new scanning hardware.
Not everything the hardware manufacturers tell you during their sales routine will be suitable for your project or source material. You should always think very carefully before investing in new scanning equipment and ideally test it using your own source material before purchase. In particular, you should closely examine features such as the device's light dependency, resolution, opening angle, ergonomic design, and efficiency. If possible, arrange to put the hardware through its paces in your own scanning room.
