## Do: include scalable hardware in your planning.
Key elements of the overall technical system should be scalable. Virtualization, for example, makes it easier to scale up your hardware resources. It is also worth considering right from the start of your project whether to outsource some of the more CPU- intensive workflow steps such as data conversion. When choosing the file system, you should ensure that it is efficiently structured so that it can deal with large volumes of data and so that the amount of storage can be increased flexibly.
System resources should be monitored actively to prevent disruption and identify scaling requirements in good time.
