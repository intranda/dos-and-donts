## Do: harness the experience of project staff in your planning.
Although staff who have spent a great deal of time working on other projects may be reluctant to adopt new methods, their knowledge and experience is tremendously valuable when it comes to redesigning workflows or planning new ones. You will need to harness that experience so that you can design an effective new workflow that covers every single task from start to finish. It follows that the workflow should never be imposed "from above" by management without input from project staff. This participatory approach to workflow planning also promotes greater acceptance of new methods and tools.
