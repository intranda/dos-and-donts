## Don't: allow the scanning software to perform automatic cropping
The option to let your scanning software crop images automatically may sound attractive as a way of reducing your workload, but the potential benefits and disadvantages should be carefully weighed up for each project. If the images are cropped too heavily, the project may not be able – at some point in the future – to generate more information from them than was anticipated at the time of scanning. For this reason, especially in the case of valuable materials that should ideally not be exposed to multiple scanning, it is important to ensure that the master image is produced with a generous all-round margin.
The scanning program should never be instructed to automatically perform ‘heavy cropping' of master images. Instead, an automated cropping step can be incorporated into the remaining workflow using a derivative image and selected parameters. This step can be performed as many times as required without changing the master image.
