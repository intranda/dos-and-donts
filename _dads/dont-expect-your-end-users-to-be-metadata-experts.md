## Don't: expect your end users to be metadata experts.
Don't assume that the end users of you digitized material will have anything more than a superficial knowledge of metadata. The contents of your online digital collections do not need to meet the stringent requirements of a library catalogue. For most users, it is more than enough to provide a link from the digitized object to the full catalog entry. This streamlined approach will save a great deal of workflow time otherwise spent manually extracting and recording metadata.
