## Do: think twice before deciding to use a scanning robot for your digitization project.
A scanning robot may not be the right choice for some types of source material. Tasks such as preparing the books, loading and unloading, and making fine adjustments for individual book formats can be relatively time-consuming depending on the model. Furthermore, not all books are equally suitable for scanning by a book robot. Experience has shown that current scanning robots are not yet reliable or autonomous enough to be able to operate entirely without supervision. The time required by a human supervisor to monitor the work of the robot and to load the device and make fine adjustments for each book can be as much as for manual scanning.
