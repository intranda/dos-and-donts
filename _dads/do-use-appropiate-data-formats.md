## Do: use appropriate data formats.
All data formats used in digitization projects should be chosen carefully. Wherever possible, digitized output and metadata should be stored using standardized file formats that are well-established and suitable for machine processing. In exceptional cases, if you need to use your own proprietary data format, you should ensure that your files are nevertheless machine-readable, e.g. by using an XML file structure.
