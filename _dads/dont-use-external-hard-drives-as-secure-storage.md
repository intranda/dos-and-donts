## Don't: use external hard drives as secure storage.
External hard drives and USB memory sticks are not suitable for backing-up or archiving purposes. Every digitization project should have a robust and properly designed infrastructure to ensure that the output data are permanently and securely stored.
Bear in mind that it may not be possible to redigitize the same object. You should therefore ensure that your digital copy of the object is safely and permanently stored. It may even be worth storing the data twice in separate locations.
