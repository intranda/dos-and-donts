## Do: avoid as much manual processing as possible.
It is worth checking carefully which digitization workflow tasks really need to be performed manually. Many recurring jobs can now be automated or at least partly automated using appropriate software.

Integrating these tools into your workflow as automated tasks not only saves time but also ensures that your results are consistent in terms of quality, data formats and naming systems.
