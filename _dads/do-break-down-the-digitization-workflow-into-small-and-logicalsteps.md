## Do: break down the digitization workflow into small and logical steps.
Workflow tasks that need to be performed for every object (e.g. for every book) should be broken down into smaller steps. Each step should be planned in such a way that it can ideally be completed relatively quickly by appropriately trained staff in the designated user groups. Rather than:

- "Digitize a book, extract and record the metadata and publish it online",

it would be better to break down the workflow as follows:
- Person A: Scan (book by book).
- Person B: Extract/record metadata (book by book)
- Person C: Publish (book by book)

Using this approach, the status of each object is clear and verifiable throughout the workflow. It also greatly increases productivity, as project staff repeatedly perform the same task for multiple objects without having to familiarize themselves with a different role.
