## Do: validate your images automatically, ideally straight after scanning
Wherever technically possible, image files should be validated automatically as soon as they have been scanned, i.e. before performing any further tasks in the workflow. The free software JHove has proven effective for common methods of validation (e.g. of TIF files). It can be run automatically from a command line instruction and can return a machine-readable validation result in the form of an XML file.
It may also be worth validating file names at an early stage in the workflow. Software tools like â€˜regular expressions' can force project staff to comply with established naming schemes. They can also ensure that numerical sequences in file names are unbroken or that the file name includes relevant metadata.
