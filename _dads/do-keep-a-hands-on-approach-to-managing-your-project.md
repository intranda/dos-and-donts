## Do: keep a hands-on approach to managing your project.
Project managers should work through each step of the workflow from start to finish at least once a year to ensure that they fully understand it, and if necessary ask the corresponding member of the project team to explain what is involved. This helps to disseminate and document knowledge across the entire project. It is also a good way to identify potential improvements and address typical pitfalls (e.g. "We've always done it that way").
