## Don't: create complex workflows with many side branches and loops.
Workflows should always be designed to run sequentially. Wherever possible, you should avoid repetition, branching and other complex procedures entirely. Especially if you are dealing with a large volume of data, simple and sequential workflows ensure that each step is easily traceable, making the task of identifying errors and maintaining your systems and workflows much easier.
