## Do: get started!
While of course it makes sense to plan your project thoroughly and cover all eventualities, there comes a point when it makes equal sense to just get started. When taking that decision, you should consider the following points.

- Extracting and recording metadata is worthwhile, but only if the metadata is relevant and of some real benefit to the end user.
- Your choice of image quality (i.e. resolution) should take account of the visual capacity of the human eye. This principle also applies to compressed images and potential artefacts (keywords: visual lossless).
- Give some thought to the future maintenance requirements for the technical infrastructure and data formats so that any wrong decisions can be corrected at a later stage.
