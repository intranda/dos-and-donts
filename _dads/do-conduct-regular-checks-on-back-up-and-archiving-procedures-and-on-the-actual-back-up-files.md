## Do: conduct regular checks on back-up and archiving procedures and on the actual back-up files.
Back-up and archiving procedures should be checked at regular intervals. Ideally, these checks should be performed in line with a regular schedule (e.g. every six months).
At the same time as you check that a back-up copy has been correctly produced, you should also check that it can be correctly retrieved, read and processed.
