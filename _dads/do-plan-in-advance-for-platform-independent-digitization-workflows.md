## Do: plan in advance for platform-independent digitization workflows.
There are some very good software tools that can only run on certain operating systems (e.g. Windows or Mac). Ideally, you should plan your workflows from the start in such a way that individual steps can also be performed on other operating systems. This gives you maximum flexibility over your future working methods and avoids the risk of "vendor lock-in".
