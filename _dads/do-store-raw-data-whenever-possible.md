## Do: store raw data whenever possible.
The raw data produced in the course of individual workflow steps should be stored whenever it is feasible and useful to do so. By way of example, the original OCR raw data format can be used at a later stage to provide further information to supplement that available from the converted data, e.g. information about the layout, fonts, languages, recognition accuracy rates, and statistics. Even the master digitized images can be used later on to extract further information.
