## Do: remember that your output should be designed to last.
In most cases, the output of a digitization project should remain usable for a long time. Furthermore, since digitization projects often extend over a long period, all workflows should be organized in such a way that the plans can still be followed much later. Directory structures, filenames and formats should be as clear and simple as possible, ideally self-explanatory. Future project staff should always be able to locate documentation describing and explaining each step of the workflow to ensure a smooth transition in the event of personnel changes.
