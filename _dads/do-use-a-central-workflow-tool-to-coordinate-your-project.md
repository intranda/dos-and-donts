## Do: use a central workflow tool to coordinate your project.
Ideally, the tasks performed for each digitized object should be precisely verifiable so that you can maintain a clear overview of progress and any hold-ups and monitor any recurring errors and the circumstances in which they arise. Microsoft Excel and a central network drive with write access for each member of the project team are not usually adequate for this purpose. For this reason, you should consider whether to adopt a professional work-flow management tool. These are available under an open-source license and with a large community of users.
